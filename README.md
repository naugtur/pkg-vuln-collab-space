# Package Vulnerability Management & Reporting Collaboration Space

### Mission Statement

Today maintainers deal with a significant influx of issues, PRs (re. updating dependencies) & broader comms when a new CVE is reported on a popular library in our ecosystem. Many of these are being considered "false positives" from an impact/vulnerability perspective. This level of noise creates distrust in the relationships between security companies/researchers, maintainers, & the collective end-users/consumers.

By creating a neutral forum to discuss & ideate across this ecosystem's stakeholders, we hope to improve CVE reporting & resolution workflows; Minimizing burden on maintainers & noise for consumers.

Examples of desired or successful outcomes from this discourse/space:

* Improved delineation of domains & controls
* Improved communication between maintainers & security researchers/organizations
* Improved tooling for package auditing, resolution & management as a whole
  * ex. package maintainers have a mechanism to flag/counterclaim vulnerability reports of dependencies that do not affect their own usage/workflows
  * ex. end-users have a mechanism to more granularly control the visibility of the vulnerability reports of their dependencies (including filtering on flags/counterclaims)
